## About

![](./doc/assets/logo-lr-bg.svg)

**Expert Kit (EK)** is a high-performance framework for scalable MoE (Mixture of Experts) LLM inference. The vision of EK is to provide an efficient foundation of Expert Parallelism (EP) on heterogeneous hardware (e.g., CPU and GPU) over commodity networks (e.g. PCIe, TCP, RDMA), thereby enabling easy deployment and fine-grained expert-level scaling.

EK features Expert-Attention (E/A) separation architecture, enabling MoE LLMs to be deployed efficiently in a distributed environment composed of _x_ CPUs and _y_ GPUs.
The motivation behind the E/A separation lies in our observation that, in modern MoE LLMs, expert parameters account for the vast majority of the model size (e.g., over 90% in DeepSeek-V3).
By decoupling expert modules and deploying them across distributed GPUs and CPUs, EK leverages the high bandwidth and large capacity of distributed memory and storage systems.

## Quick Start

Here are some tutorials to help you quickly start with Expert Kit.

1. [DeepSeek-tiny](./doc/tutorial/standalone/deepseek-tiny.md): A tailored MoE model with DeepSeek-V3 architecture and small parameter count, designed for quick evaluation and testing of the Expert Kit framework.
2. [DeepSeek-V3](./doc/tutorial/standalone/deepseek-v3.md): A demo for running the DeepSeek-V3 model with Expert Kit, showcasing the framework's capabilities in handling large-scale MoE models. 
3. [Qwen3-30B-A3B](./doc/tutorial/standalone/qwen3-moe-a3b-demo.md): A demo for running the Qwen3-30B-A3B model with Expert Kit, showcasing the framework's capabilities in handling real-world MoE models.

## Key Features

- **Low-Cost Deployment**: supports distributed and mixed GPUs and CPUs.
- **Fine-Grained Expert-Level Scalability**: provides independent scaling of attention and experts, with dynamic scaling of hot experts on demand
